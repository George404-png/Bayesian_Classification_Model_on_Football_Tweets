In this article, we take a look at 10 of the most promising ones. Jude Bellingham, 2003 – England Wyscout report: Jude Bellingham There’s nothing normal in Jude Bellingham’s path to professional football so far. At 17, he already experienced a £26M transfer – the most expensive ever for a 17-year-old youngster. – As a first-team regular with Borussia Dortmund, a goal in a Champions League quarter-final (against future finalist Man City) and an honor usually reserved to football legends at the end of their career, his jersey with the number 22 retired by his former club Birmingham City FC. The last step has been the call-up to play the Euros, making him the youngest player in England’s squad and the second youngest of the whole tournament after Poland’s Kacper Kozlowski, three and a half months younger than him. At least at the beginning of the tournament, Bellingham shouldn’t have a central role among the Three Lions – although he already became the youngest ever to play at the Euros, being subbed in at the 82nd minute of England’s opener against Croatia. In the past months, since his debut against Ireland in November, he’s almost never been a regular for Southgate. But in the only match played from the first minute before the European championship – the friendly match against Austria in early June - Bellingham played so well that many people now expect him to be played as a starter soon. But that’s not so easy. Henderson, Rice and Phillips provide balance and cover behind England’s most advanced lines, both vital skills to balance the Three Lions’ massive offensive talent. Bellingham, on the other hand, tends more to move around the pitch, helping to get the ball in the last third and running in the box. It’s really up to what kind of midfield Southgate wants to play with, either more balanced and control-oriented, or brave and supportive of offensive players. Whatever the case may be, for his very ability to change the tempo in the midfield, Bellingham can play an important role in this tournament, even if not playing as a starter. Jérémy Doku, 2002 – Belgium Wyscout report: Jeremy Doku Belgium is the most experienced team at the Euros, with the highest average age of the tournament and the highest number of international caps in their 23-man squad. The only exception, and the only Under-23 player called by Roberto Martinez, is Jérémy Doku. It’s not a surprise. Doku debuted last November and he starts the Euros with a tally of eight games and two goals with the Red Devils- the same amount scored in the 30 matches played with Rennes in the last Ligue 1 season. He arrived in France last October from Anderlecht, with great expectations around him. The transfer was quite expensive - €26M + bonuses- and he immediately forced himself into the starting XI, playing on the wing, both on the right and left flank. But he wasn’t very effective from an offensive perspective (only two goals and three assists in the campaign) and he mainly showed his ability to beat his man in 1v1s. After Mbappé, he’s the player who completed the most dribbles in Ligue 1. He’s not a starter for Belgium but with his electric style of play, his speed and his talent in 1v1s, he can change games even starting from the bench. Nuno Mendes, 2002 – Portugal Wyscout report: Nuno Mendes There’s maybe no team in the Euros with fullbacks as good with the ball as Portugal. Cancelo and Guerreiro are two certainties (although Cancelo will miss the Euros after being tested positive for Covid-19, being replaced by Diogo Dalot), with the latter being a vital part of Borussia Dortmund’s possession and coming from a season with five goals and nine assists in Bundesliga. Behind them, there’s also Nuno Mendes, one of the best and most promising players in the recently crowned Portuguese champions Sporting Lisbon. Mendes has the softest left foot, he’s great at crossing, and has an amazing vision. He can carry the ball up the pitch, but he doesn’t need to reach the final third to create dangerous situations. He only needs to look up when still in his third and use his long passes. Cristiano Ronaldo is well aware of that, as it was Nuno Mendes himself to assist him from the left flank for the infamous disallowed goal against Serbia at the end of March, when a fuming Portugal captain left the pitch, furiously throwing his armband to the ground.

In a more recent friendly match against Spain, Nuno Mendes stood out with yet another long pass, this time from his own left half. A mid-air, curling pass that once again found Cristiano Ronaldo behind the Spanish line. The Juventus striker, though, failed to control the ball with his head and wasn’t able to shoot.

Guerreiro is likely to start at left fullback for the tournament but as he’s not always 100% reliable from a physical perspective, Nuno Mendes may have his chances, even if only for a few minutes from time to time. Adam Hlozek, 2002, Czech Republic Wyscout report: Adam Hlozek In the context of the Czech league, Adam Hlozek looked simply unstoppable. In 19 matches played in his campaign with Sparta Prague – he lost 4 months for a foot injury – he scored 15 goals and served seven assists. In total, he contributed to 22 goals, the highest number in the league, he’s been the best goal scorer and the fourth-best assist man, even by playing half season. Hlozek's assist against Lille - Image created with Wyscout Playlist & Draw feature. It’s impossible not to be impressed by these numbers and in fact, Czech manager Jaroslav Silhavy called him up for the European Championship. So far, though, he only played three matches – only one as a starter, against Slovakia last September. The starting forward is Schick, and Silhavy can also count on Krmencik and Vydra, both very technical but not so strong from a physical perspective. Hlozek, on the other hand, is a polished striker from a technical standpoint, he can move a lot and also play on the wing. He’s ambitious and can produce moments of pure bright, spectacular goals and complex assists like the one with his back heel against Lille, in his only 45 minutes played in the Europa League last season. Maybe he won’t be able to get noticed in the European Championship, but Hlozek has everything that the Czech team needs: technique, ambition and energy. Jurrien Timber, 2001 – Netherlands Wyscout report: Justin Timber In other circumstances, Jurries Timber wouldn’t likely become part of the Dutch defense so quickly. But injuries played a major role. The knee injury suffered by van Dijk last October, de Ligt’s more recent muscular problem, the various setbacks suffered by Blind recently. De Boer’s change of system also played its part – from a 4-3-3 to a 3-5-2, other than being heavily criticized in the country. The central role in the middle of the defense has then been taken by Timber – with no little surprise, as he took advantage of other players’ injuries to debut with the senior national team, playing the last two friendlies before the Euros against Scotland and Georgia. Even if he played 88 minutes in the 3-2 win in the opener against Ukraine, it’s not sure whether Timber will retain his position as a starter. In theory, de Ligt, de Vrij and Blind should be the first choices for the position, but Timber was already preferred over more experienced defenders like Aké and Veltman. He showed clean passing and bravery in possession, also building up in advanced positions, all vital skills for a right halfback in a three-man defense. He plays for Ajax and he became a starter there in the second half of the season. It will be interesting to see if he will retain his position as a starter once all his older teammates have recovered. Billy Gilmour, 2001 – Scotland Wyscout report: Billy Gilmour It hasn’t been an easy season for Billy Gilmour. He almost never played for Chelsea – also because of a torn meniscus which forced him to lose the first months, and also because of the impressive level of the competition in the midfield: Kanté, Jorginho and Kovacic alternated in the two-man midfield mostly used by Tuchel. But he was still called up for the Euros by the Scottish manager Steve Clarke, who played him in the two friendlies played before the tournament against Netherlands and Luxembourg. On both occasions, Gilmour started from the bench. In the last minutes, playing as an inside-forward against the Netherlands and at the beginning of the second half against Luxembourg, playing in front of the defense but in a peculiar situation: against a modest opponent who was one man down for a red card. Scotland kept possession almost the whole half and Gilmour had all the time to build up every play. Billy Gilmour's position against Luxembourg - Image created with Wyscout Playlist & Draw feature. It’s not a likely scenario for the Euros. Clarke prefers to have more solid midfielders defensively to play in that position and Gilmour – other than being the rookie, has other skills, unique ones in the Scottish squad. He builds the play, covering a lot of ground to give options to his teammates. Qualities that are poorly valorized by a team who like to use long passes, not passing much by the center of the pitch. But Gilmour is the brightest talent of Scottish football and Clarke, by calling him up, wanted to give him a signal and give him a chance. If he’ll be looking for some quality for his team at the Euros, he knows who to call. Ethan Ampadu, 2000 – Wales Wyscout report: Ethan Ampadu Since he replaced Ryan Giggs, Wales’ new manager Robert Page gave his team a clear shape: three at the back, two center-mids, two wingers and a quick and dynamic offensive line, able to be dangerous in transition. Within this new system, Ethan Ampadu is one of the pillars, equally reliable when he plays as one of the three center-backs or one of the two midfielders, the position in which Page played him the most. Ampadu played as center midfielder - Image created with Wyscout Playlist & Draw feature. At the Euros, is likely for Ampadu to be played in the midfield – although he didn’t start at all in the opener against Switzerland – and that he will be requested to protect the space in front of the defense, a zone that Wales cover with great care, starting from the offensive line, which directs the opponent build up on the flanks by playing tight. Ampadu moves in vital spaces for Wales’ defensive effectiveness, and he must be ready to cover possible gaps in the lines, if an offensive winger loses his 1v1 or fails to recover, or if a center back is drawn out of position. His performances will be very important for the solidity of the system and therefore for Wales’ tournament itself. Giacomo Raspadori, 2000 – Italy Wyscout report: Giacomo Raspadori The reasons for Giacomo Raspadori’s surprising call up for the Euros aren’t to be found in his last season’s numbers. Raspadori only played as a starter in the last part of the campaign, he hasn’t scored much (six goals) and before May, he was never even discussed as one of the possible players for Italy. It was clear that Immobile and Belotti would’ve alternated in the heart of the Azzurri’s attack, and the most plausible third option was Kean, which has the same age as Raspadori, but much more experience. He played for big clubs like Juventus and Paris Saint-Germain and debuted with the national team in 2018, other than being able to play both as a center-forward and offensive winger. Raspadori is way less experienced, less adaptable but has qualities that Mancini was looking for and hasn’t found with Immobile, Belotti and Kean. Those of a striker who’s not only capable of link-up play, but also to be involved in possession. He knows how to play away from the defensive line and pass the ball, skills that he fine tuned by playing with Sassuolo, a team which is used to keeping the ball and attacking organized defenses, thus sharing some tactical principles with Italy. The hierarchies of the Italian offense are clear, but Belotti and Immobile always struggled to keep up with expectations with the national team, guaranteeing the same performances they had with their clubs, and Raspadori seems fit to take the lead of a team that wants to dominate possession and attack tight spaces. On paper, he shouldn’t play much but he could be Italy’s unexpected hero. Alexander Isak, 1999 – Sweden Wyscout report: Alexander Isak Without Ibrahimović, who had to give up on the Euros due to a knee injury, the most hyped Sweden attacker is Alexander Isak, who just finished a season with 17 goals with Real Sociedad. Isak is tall and technical and – for these features - he’s often been compared to Ibrahimović himself. He actually is a quick and slim striker, who loves to run vertically and open on the left flank, where he can either cross or cut to the center to pass the ball behind the defensive line. Isak's through pass against Russia - Image created with Wyscout Playlist & Draw feature. He doesn’t attract all balls as Ibra does, he’s less able to be a link for teammates to rely on when moving up the pitch, but has superb control at high speeds and he can gain his team lots of space by carrying the ball, also having impressive ‘eureka’ moments. He’s more than a striker for transitions in open spaces, he can also take the ball in the final third and serve through passes behind the defensive line. He hasn’t always been a starter for Sweden but he’s the best striker of the team and his performances will have a certain impact on the team’s path at the Euros. (Keep an eye out for an upcoming Scouting Time episode focused on Alexander Isak!) Mykola Shaparenko, 1998, Ukraine Wyscout report: Mykola Shaparenko Shirt number 10 and always on the move to touch the ball to create new lines of passing, Mykola Shaparenko is the inside-forward that gives Ukraine’s possession continuity, as he wants to manage every possession that passes in his zone. He mainly plays on the left but covers a huge part of the pitch, he can receive the first pass from the center backs and then follow the play up to the opposite third, continuously engaging his teammates around him, and moving just afterward to close the give-and-go. In the last season, he won all national silverware with Dynamo Kyiv: the championship – scoring 4 goals and serving 3 assists, the Ukrainian Cup and the Supercup. With the national team, he played as a starter most times in the past months but the Ukrainian manager – football legend Andriy Shevchenko, has a lot of options for his midfield and eventually, Shaparenko could play less than expected (he was subbed in at the 64th minute in the loss against the Netherlands). Ukraine has a young and qualitative team and in that context, a player like Shaparenko – able to increase and enhance the connections with his teammates, could play a vital role to let others around him shine.

Toggle menu Toggle menu The best players at the 2019 U-20 World Cup by L'Ultimo Uomo 30 May 2019 Scouting Time In case you missed it, the 2019 U-20 World Cup started a couple of days ago and we already had the chance to see some pretty interesting talent on the pitch. In order not to miss the most exciting ones, we asked L’Ultimo Uomo to profile the seven best of them. Enjoy! Luca Pellegrini, Italy (AS Roma) The first time I saw Luca Pellegrini playing, I had no idea who he was. More than three years ago, I was watching a training of Alberto De Rossi’s Primavera (the U-19 team in Italy) to write an article about a player that would’ve remained unnoticed, to tell the story of a young player that was starting to become a professional, not being one yet. At some point during the pick-up game, the ball got to the left full-back on the other side of the pitch. Edoardo Soleri (’97), that in those days had just played his first Champions League game, pressed him. The full-back got rid of him, leaping the ball over with a soft touch – the kind of touch that in Rome we call “cucchiaio”, honouring Francesco Totti – and turning around him, then getting the ball back to his feet. And Edoardo Soleri is 1.90m tall. I remember that I had a gasp on the bench, asking somebody who that full-back was. He was Luca Pellegrini, of course. All Roma Primavera players really looked anxious to become pros and very focused on trying to understand which place the football world would’ve had for them. Pellegrini, that was two years younger than his teammates (he’s born on March 1999), wandered through the cafeteria with lightness, sometimes, somebody told me, carrying Mike Tyson’s autobiography with him. I don’t know if Tyson’s story has been an inspiration for this self-confident – almost cocky – young man, nor did I understood why that detail meant so much to the person that told me that in the first place, but three years later, Luca Pellegrini has already made it through two severe left knee injuries (ACL and patella), continuing his path. The injuries forced him to miss almost the whole 2017/18 season and this year, Pellegrini played his first complete Serie A season (with just a few little stops, like an ankle sprain). First as a reserve in Di Francesco’s Roma, then as a starter in Rolando Maran’s Cagliari. To take hit like those you surely need technical and physical skills, but also a massive mental strength. An example of Pellegrini’s control and intelligence: after avoiding the opponents’ pressure with quick footwork and forcefully attacking the wing thanks to a triangle pass with his teammate, he stops and lifts his head. He could cross in the box, where his teammates are outnumbered, but he rather chooses to favour his teammate’s input from the back. To do that, he has to wait for his opponent to stop his run, leaving the passing line open. How many full-backs have this understanding of the game and management of the plays’ tempo? Right now, Luca Pellegrini is playing in the U-20 World Cup, in the midfield, as a Mezzala (inside forward) and maybe, but just maybe, someone who doesn’t know him well could say that it’s not his position. Mostly thanks to his left foot. Pellegrini’s technique is superb, his ball control in every moment and the ductility with which he uses both the inside and the outside of his foot allows him to play in the narrow spaces, even with first-touches with the opponent behind him. If only his shooting was as good as his passing, he could really have a future as an inside forward. Surely, Pellegrini performs best when he has open space in front of him, combining his technique with an exceptional athleticism (that, apparently, hasn’t been damaged by injuries). Pellegrini can run quickly, just following the ball in the open spaces, or with a creative dribble, both in the inside and the flank of the pitch (often using his heel, a skill that we admire in pure Trequartisi, like Cristiano Ronaldo). His crosses are always very accurate and, most of all, he always lifts his head before crossing, looking at his teammates and picking up the right one to receive the ball. Di Francesco excluded him from the squad’s rotations after that his defensive inexperience caused a penalty during the game against SPAL. Even if it’s true that a little lack of experience is only right for a kid that has just turned 20 and has missed an entire season, it’s also true that Pellegrini’s skills are way more useful in the offensive phase, rather than in the defensive one. But he’s working hard on this and his athleticism can help him improve his usefulness around his own box. For example, once again against SPAL but this time with Cagliari shirt, he saved an opponent goal occasion with a nice interception in the box. So, Luca Pellegrini lacks nothing and, other his legs and a remarkable left foot, he also seems to have an above-average mind. The U-20 World Cup, in a team full of players with a possible future in Serie A (like Scamacca, another Roma academy player that is now owned by Sassuolo, that already shined with 2 assists in 2 games), could be the perfect showcase for the 2019/20 season in which, theoretically, he should be part of the revolution of Roma. Much is depending on the new Giallorossi coach, that was Ranieri until a few days ago. Luca Pellegrini’s skills and ductility make him useful in almost any tactic, but it’s his intelligence that could really allow him to become one of Italy’s best full-backs in no time. Lee Kang-in (called Kangin in Spain), South Korea (Valencia) by Emiliano Battazzi Kangin’s story is almost everything that a kid shouldn’t be allowed to do and, at the same time, everything that a kid, and a family, can do to realize a dream. Kangin was almost six when he took part in a popular South Korean reality show; his team won, and he went to Manchester to record a tv commercial with Park Ji-Sung. At 10, he arrived halfway around the world, in Spain, for a tryout with Valencia. A city that only has a massive consume of rice in common with South Korea. Due to linguistic problems – nobody understood anything – young Kangin had his tryout with kids born in 2000, a year before him: in that group, there were Ferrán Torres and Abel Ruiz. Kangin proved all his skills: Valencia wanted to sign him but, of course, it had a big problem: you can’t sign a 10-years old kid. The only chance was for the entire family to move to Valencia, for business purposes. Of course, nobody in the club actually believed that the transfer could’ve become a reality. And yet, 7 years later, Kangin debuted with Valencia shirt in a friendly match, then scoring a goal during the Naranja Trophy, after playing for a while with the second team. Being a quick player, able to dribble his opponents on the wings, Marcelino immediately liked him a lot and Kangin debuted in the Copa del Rey in October, in LaLiga in January, and in Europa League in February. Now he’s playing the U-20 World Cup. View this post on Instagram Hoy se ha cumplido mi primer sueño desde que llegué a Valencia,ser jugador de la primera plantilla del @valenciacf ! Gracias al @valenciacf ,a los aficionados por las muestras se cariño y a todos aquellos que me habéis ayudado! Amunt Valencia!🦇 오늘은 발렌시아의 정식 1군 선수가 되어 저에게는 매우 특별한 날입니다. @valenciacf , 항상 응원으로 지지해주시는 팬분들, 지금까지 저를 위해 힘써주신 모든 분들께 감사드립니다. 아문트 발렌시아!🦇 A post shared by 이강인-KANGIN LEE (@kanginleeoficial) on Jan 30, 2019 at 12:21pm PST Only a few players in Europe, especially at his age, have Kangin’s speed and technique in the narrow spaces: sometimes, his opponents doubling on him only seems to encourage him to invent new tricks. Even if he played a lot as trequartista in the academy, right now the position that Marcelino chose for him seems the right one for his first steps in professional football. Kangin still needs to improve his physique, even if a strong underside allows him to always keep the ball control, even when he’s pressed; most of all, he still has to develop his understanding of the game, that is still too rough and self-centred. In the meantime, Kangin is developing quickly: in the crazy (and then decisive) comeback in the Copa del Rey against Getafe, the two winning goals in the injury time arrived thanks to his two amazing hockey passes (second assists). Kangin had a dream that is now realizing: with an attitude that in Valencia people call military but that actually is Korean education. Mickaël Cuisance, France (Borussia Mönchengladbach) by Daniele V. Morrone In recent years, the French football school has probably been the best one in developing players with a top-class technique and an outstanding dynamism. Mickaël Cuisance, who is playing the U-20 World Cup with France, is the last one of a long series of this kind of players. The first thing that impresses about Cuisance it’s the clean technique in every ball fundamentals (from oriented control to pure shooting) and his remarkable creativity. Thanks to his ball control technique, Cuisance is perfectly comfortable even in the narrowest spaces around the box. There, his speciality is the last pass: he has an understanding of the game that goes way beyond the easiest solution, and his sensitivity in the left foot allows him to find the perfect touch for every kind of pass he wants to make, also being able to keep his coldness and precision. A few years ago, he confessed that Zidane has always been his inspiration: “I’m a huge Zinedine Zidane fan, he’s my role model when I play football.” Cuisance receives the ball at the edge of the box, drawing the attention of the whole defence, so as to be able to serve his teammate with an inside pass. Thanks to a well-structured body and a good balance, though, he has no problems in playing in open spaces. His peripheral vision and ability to find himself in the right space at the right time makes him perfectly capable of playing in a more rearward position, to help with the build-up of the play. In this case, Cuisance continuously moves to help the progress of the play on the pitch: ideally, he creates first-touch triangles, but he can also shoot a long ball or, if necessary, free himself with a skill move. That’s why in the U-20 French team he’s played as an inside forward with the license of moving around the pitch, then being able to take advantage of his technique from box to box. Also in Bundesliga, with ‘Gladbach’, he plays in the midfield, where he’s usually flanked by a more static player. Cuisance passes over his opponent with a dribble, carrying the ball forward and then assisting with an accurate ball his teammate running wide. Born and raised in Strasbourg in 1999, when he was 13 the RC Strasbourg Alsace went bankrupt and was forced to close its academy. Cuisance had then to find another minor team in the city to keep playing. In no time, though, he signed for Nancy, one of the best academies in the region, famous for developing, among others, Le Roi Michel Platini. He’s regularly selected for the French youth teams since the U-16. Even before playing with the first team, he’s signed by Borussia Monchengladbach in the summer of 2017 for €250k. And surprisingly, in Germany, he debuts in professional football at just 18. Last season, when he only expected to debut in the first team, Cuisance played much more games for Gladbach, becoming a key player in the starting 11. In the 2018/19 season, however, Gladbach surprised him once again by sending him with the second team: Cuisance has started only one Bundesliga game, playing a total of 312 minutes, almost 1000 minutes less than last season. The very U-20 World Cup he’s playing as one of France best players could be the perfect showcase to convince his team that he’s ready to be treated a first-string or at least to find the right offer that will let his enormous talent be appreciated elsewhere. Leonardo Campana, Ecuador (Barcelona de Guayaquil) by Fabrizio Gabrielli The breakthrough of Leonardo Campana, centre forward for U-20 Equador national team and Barcelona de Guayaquil, rather than a process of meticulous planning of talent capitalization, seems to respond to those – rarer and rarer – dynamics that starts with an epiphany. In fact, during the Sudamericano Sub20 played last January in Chile, Campana wasn’t a starter. A series of contingencies, though, overturned the team’s hierarchies (Stiven Plaza, that had just been bought by Valladolid, was prohibited to participate at the tournament and Djorkaeff Reasco had a serious injury): Campana scored 6 goals – as many as the whole Brazil squad – and became top goal scorer of the tournament that Ecuador, a bit surprisingly, won for its first time in history. Campana perfectly fits into the identikit of the modern striker: he has an imposing body structure, even if his muscle mass hasn’t fully developed yet. He’s nicknamed “La Torre” (The Tower), even if his game doesn’t recall the typical cliché of the towering striker (at the Sudamericano, none of his goals was a header) and he prefers to use his body for covering the ball in order to advance the play. Thanks to his flexibility, Campana has his best skills in reactivity and explosiveness. Another defining ability is the aggressiveness: he wins back an average of 2.3 balls per game in the opponent midfield, and his main zone of influence is that ‘no man’s land’ between the midfield and the area, that is usually covered by the centre forward and that he often uses to win the ball, anticipate the ball-carrier and restart the play. Campana hadn’t the typical player development: he’s not from a context where having success in football could become a tool for social emancipation. In many ways, he’s a privileged, as his father, Pablo Campana Sáenz, a former tennis player with participation at the Olympics and the Davis Cup, is now Ecuador Minister for Foreign Trade. At the same time, he inherited the commitment and perseverance to improving his physical condition from his father. And he’s one of the very few who had the chance to score his first professional goal (one month ago, with Ecuadorian Barcelona) in a stadium named after his maternal grandfather. His scoring ability on the Sudamericano (and also in the youth teams, which he scored 35 goals in 35 games with the Sub-16 and Sub-18; in the first team, he scored 2 goals in just about 200 minutes played) gives us the picture of a very efficient capitalizer (he shots an average of 1.80 times per game with a 60% conversion rate) that is true but now complete: Campana is, most of all, a very technical player, with an impressive dribbling ability in narrow spaces, and a superb creativity. He enjoys unpredictable solutions like dribbling with the heel or controlling the ball with complicated first-touches. Sometimes he’s a little bit self-centred, he likes to show his technical skills, even becoming arrogant at times: his plays, though, are always aesthetically pleasant and somehow iconic, like his bicycle kick against Venezuela or the play against Perù above. Last March, he played his first game with the Tri first team and Felipe Caicedo seems certain about who will inherit his shirt in the Ecuadorian attack in the next years after this participation at the U-20 World Cup. Gedson Fernandes, Portugal (Benfica) by Marco D’Ottavi If you watch some videos of Gedson Fernandes outside the pitch, like this one where he challenges the other Benfica wonderkid Joao Felix to a quiz, you can realize he’s only 20. Because otherwise, he’s the typical “more mature of his age” kind of player. Arrived in Portugal when he was very young from the Sao Tome e Principe island, after a sudden rise in Benfica academy, Fernandes has become a regular in this season’s first team, collecting a total of 46 caps in his first year, with 16 games between Champions and Europa League. Rare regard for such a young player in an important club like Benfica, that already allowed him to debut with Portugal first team, rising up his figure of talented predestined. Gedson is a midfielder that can do lots of things, 10 years ago we would have probably labelled him as a “box-to-box” midfielder, that today is the perfect outline of a dynamic inside forward in a 3-man midfield. Thanks to an imposing physique and very long legs, Fernandes is capable of being incisive in both phases of the game in an unconventional way: when he has to defend, he manages to win the ball back from the opponent even in difficult situations, using the legs like a long compass (he makes 3.4 tackles per 90/mins and wins 70% of them); on the other hand, in the offensive phase he uses his wide stride to generate plays thanks to a sometimes inaccurate, and yet potentially lethal, dibbling (he tries 2.5 dribbles per 90/mins, with a 50% success rate), that allows him to break the lines by carrying the ball with apparent ease, also thanks to an uncommon mobility for a 1.84m tall player. Gedson 1⃣9⃣:0⃣4⃣ Gedson 👌 Posted by Sport Lisboa e Benfica on Saturday, December 29, 2018 Some examples of Gedson Fernandes’ dribbles, that sometimes aren’t so elegant but they’re always vertical. He’s a very propositional player without the ball, showing a natural instinct for the offensive foray, probably for his past as a forward, that often brings him near the opponent box, so much that Bruno Lange played him as a trequartista as well. He has to improve his scoring ability: this season he has scored 3 goals (surprisingly, none in the domestic league but 2 in the Champions League) thanks 1.5 shots every 90 minutes. He seems more confident with the ball at his feet and open spaces in front of him, rather than when he has to play with his teammates, always preferring the easiest choice. At just 20, Gedson Fernandes is one of the most fascinating players in this U-20 World Cup, playing in one of the favourite teams. This summer, then, he will have to choose his path: several Premier League clubs seem willing to sign him and he must choose whether he wants to try a more competitive league right away or consolidate his game at Benfica, one of the best places for a talented player to grow. Boubacar Kamara, France (Olympique de Marseille) by Dario Saltari Age isn’t always the best parameter to judge the overall quality of a player, but it’s incredible how precocious Boubacar Kamara’s talent is. Marseille centre-back is basically born in 2000 (on November 23, 1999, to be precise) and he’s already at his third season as one of the first team’s regular, having had his debut almost two and a half years ago. When he wasn’t even 19, Kamara became a starter in one of the most important clubs in France, and he did it in a very difficult season ended with the 5th place, Frank Passi’s dismissal and 52 conceded goals (only six Ligue 1 teams conceded more). The question is: was he remarkable in standing out regardless of the situation, or Marseille defensive flaws weighted on his limits as well? Being football a team sport, it’s impossible to give this question a proper answer. But certainly, Kamara has never played like a teenage defender. First of all, Kamara has a very technical interpretation of his position: he prefers understanding the right moves to do, rather than using his body, and a precise tackle rather than physical dominance. His game, though, is not only a display of ripeness, but also a necessity: Kamara is neither quick or particularly strong from a physical standpoint, and his ability in anticipating the game becomes a way to reduce the gap the often separates him from opponent strikers. In one of the last league games against Toulouse, Kamara stops in the midfield, waiting for his direct opponent to make the first move without losing sight of the ball. For the same reasons, Kamara’s game is also very risky: the gap that divides a brilliant tackle from a failed one is very thin, especially at an age when experience can’t help you decide whether it’s preferable to attempt a tackle or wiser to wait and defend the zone. When he accomplishes things, though, Kamara is undoubtedly an exciting defender to watch, for the cleanness and timing of his tackles and the elegance that identifies his game without the ball. The most impressive aspect of his game, though, is the build-up game from the behind. Kamara has a golden right foot, which he’s capable of finding his teammates with, both thanks to long passes and super-precise vertical balls that cut the opponent lines. OM centre-back isn’t afraid of carrying the ball when he’s the last man, and this can be some sort of modern antidote to the sophisticated pressing mechanisms that rule modern football. Essentially, Kamara wants to be a modern centre-back, that enjoys a proactive team the defends way ahead of its goal line. Kamara’s playmaking skills. And in fact, Kamara is shining at the U-20 World Cup, where he’s played as right centre-back next to Zagadou, against teams that, with their technical inferiority, allow him to move forward until the midfield, basically acting as a playmaker (a position that, according to Rudi Garcia, he could actually play in). Unless he will repeat Varane’s career – a defender that he resembles – Kamara will have to work on his limits in order to be able to survive in the faster and more vertical football that is now ruling Europe. According to the French press, some issues with Kamara’s new contract at OM could cause a transfer to a big club this summer after the World Cup, and the names are the like of Chelsea and AC Milan. As he’s used to rushing things, he hasn’t so much time to lose. Erling Haaland, Norway (Red Bull Salzburg) by Emanuele Atturo If precocity can be a measure to establish the hype surrounding a wonderkid, consider that at 15 Erling Haaland has already played 16 games for Bryne, a small club one the Norwegian coast where he grew up. At 17, he signed for Molde, the club where Ole Gunnar Solskjaer grew, and he scored 14 goals in 39 games in just about a year. Haaland’s sudden rise in football continued with his transfer to Red Bull Salzburg in the summer of 2018, in a moment when he was also approached by Manchester United and Juventus. Haaland preferred an intermediate step to avoid the path of another Norwegian wonderkid, Odegaard, that is struggling to find his place in football after signing for Real Madrid. Erling is Alf Inge’s son, the same Haaland that played in Manchester City, known for his famous tackle on Roy Keane. As every other enfant prodige, Haaland has been favoured by an imposing body. His coach at Molde said that he reminds him of Romelu Lukaku. For his style of running, touching the ball and seeking space to shot, Haaland fits in the prototype of the power forward, capable of physically dominating the opponent defences. When he carries the ball with the left foot, he loves to kick it forward a few meters, losing control a bit, and then getting it back with an impossible speed for a striker that strong. Even without a gentle ball control, Haaland is quick with his feet and dangerous in narrow spaces, often finding creative solutions to pass opponents by only using his left foot. Right now, the lacking usage of the right foot is the most obvious flaw in his technical repertory, especially for his position on the pitch. What’s more, even with his powerful physique, Haaland is not so good at playing with the goal behind him. He doesn’t like to play with his teammates, but he prefers to manipulate the defensive line to seek the deep run, often bolting on the left to attack deep the space between the full-back and the centre-back. These characteristics make him potentially fit to play both as a lone striker – in a team that uses it to move forward on the pitch – and in a two-man attack line. Haaland typically getting away from his man. He wins the space from the defender by bolting on the left and then attacking the goal with a central run. The verticality of his movements, with and without the ball, his tendency at playing at the highest intensity possible, and the competition which he presses the opponent build-up with, probably are the reasons that convinced Red Bull Salzburg in investing on him. The Austrian club is one of the most interesting tactical realities in the last years, with a well-defined and clear gameplay identity. Haaland will find one of the most interesting systems to take advantage of the qualities that makes him one of the most original and interesting players of the future and, of course, of this 2019 World Cup.

Toggle menu Toggle menu Erling Håland – the rise of potential world-class talent from Norway by Just Football 5 November 2019 Scouting Time, The Match Analyst Sunday 1st July 2018 will go down as the day that Erling Braut Håland truly burst onto the scene. Before then he had long been earmarked as an exceptional young talent, but his performance away against Brann that day sent shockwaves around Norway’s Eliteserien and beyond. Heading into that contest Brann were unbeaten in 14 games, top of the table and had only conceded five goals. Yet in the blink of an eye, this fresh-faced teenager Erling Håland completely tore their season apart by scoring four goals inside the first 20 minutes. It was an astonishing feat and one sensed it announced his major footballing arrival on the big stage. Things then developed quickly. The Norwegian had an ‘Indian Summer’ of fine form. Every week he kept racking up goals, assists and fantastic performances. He was instrumental in defeating Vålerenga & Brann once again, on both occasions 5-1. There was a Europa League qualifying match away against Irish minnows Glenavon in mid-July where scouts from as many as 30+ major top-flight clubs were reported to have attended. They weren’t just there for a few pints of Guinness either. Within six weeks Erling Håland was a Red Bull Salzburg player for a fee close to £4.5m. He would join them in January 2019. The Austrian outfit knew that they had a fine young talent on their hands but even they probably didn’t foresee what has been a stratospheric rise. Since moving to Salzburg, Håland has unsurprisingly improved nearly all of his attacking statistics. His goals per 90 mins have increased by over 150% from 0.66 to an unbelievable 1.68. Perhaps even more impressively, his xG per 90 mins at Salzburg is just 0.99, so he’s comfortably performing much better in front of goal than what should be attained. At Molde, the Norwegian youngster was only just matching his xG, so there has been a significant improvement in this area. It’s a common theme in pretty much every final third department. His stats have shown some extremely positive trends. Håland’s assists per 90 mins have doubled in Austria, whilst the likes of his dribbling success rate, accurate crosses & offensive duels won have all surpassed his Molde levels. Erling Braut Håland attacking statistics for Molde in 2018 (Norway Eliteserien & UEFA Europa League). Erling Braut Håland attacking statistics since joining Salzburg (Austrian Bundesliga & UEFA Champions League). The ‘offensive duels’ category is a good one to focus on. At Molde in 2018, he was winning 35.9% of those contests. At Salzburg, that figure has increased to 44.4%. An increase of around the 10% mark in this sort of statistic isn’t to be underestimated. A lot has been made of Braut Håland’s increased physique, and he has certainly made great strides in that department. We must remember that in the 2018 season he was still a 17-year-old for Molde at one stage. Håland is now a much stronger player in terms of build and this is definitely one of the main reasons why he is winning more of these duels. He isn’t just using pure raw physical strength to outmuscle opponents though. His skill level has also improved and there are some instances below where better technical ability is enabling him to beat the opposition. Braut Håland receives a pass but is surrounded by a quartet of Napoli players. His options appear relatively limited. Napoli defenders engage with Håland but using improved strength and skill he manages to fight them off. Winning this offensive duel opens up play for Salzburg into a promising position. Some might argue that a lot of the statistical attacking improvements from Håland can simply be attributed to him being in a better team, surrounded by higher class teammates in a league that Salzburg is so dominant in. Those factors can’t be ignored but can also contribute towards someone developing into a better player themselves. However, with these individual offensive duels, it’s almost entirely down to Håland himself. What is so impressive is how he has suddenly become such a physical force in really big matches against top-quality opposition. Stepping onto club football’s biggest stage – the UEFA Champions League – has been no issue. In the sequence below he manages to comprehensively win a duel with Kalidou Koulibaly. The Senegalese international has a market value of close to £70m and is considered one of the top defenders in the world. If Håland is doing this at just 19 years of age, then imagine what he can achieve as he grows even stronger in the future? Long ball over the top and Håland is going directly head-to-head with Kalidou Koulibaly. The Napoli defender must be favourite in these sorts of situations against almost anyone, right? Håland is such a strong beast that he uses his body very effectively and emerges victorious against Koulibaly in this duel. The Senegalese man even actually fouls Erling Braut Håland, yet he still manages to escape. Success vs Koulibaly and eventually Napoli only stops him by committing a foul. In this sequence is an example of Håland using great skill to beat a defender in an offensive duel. After the ball gets played into his feet, he quickly makes a lovely flick and turns quickly to soon outsmart his opponent. For such a tall guy, Braut Håland is extremely nimble on his feet. The world now appears to be Erling Håland’s oyster. Most people always knew that a move to RB Salzburg would be a ‘stepping stone’ club for Håland if he developed as expected. But the consensus was that he’d be in Austria to develop for at least two or three seasons. It now looks like his stay will be much shorter than anticipated. In recent weeks he has been continually linked with several big clubs in Europe, from Liverpool, Manchester United and PSG to the likes of Juventus, Real Madrid and Napoli. One particular club, Manchester United, has always been earmarked as one of the favourites to land the Norwegian superstar. This is because his old boss at Molde was none other than Ole Gunnar Solskjær. However, Erling is the son of Alf-Inge Håland and in 2000 was born in Leeds whilst his father was playing for the fallen giant of English football, Leeds United. Håland is a self-confessed lifelong Leeds United fan and in 2017 once said to Norwegian newspaper Aftenposten that his overall dream is to ‘one day win the Premier League with Leeds’. That may well be a pipe dream now, but would he move to Leeds’ arch-rivals across the Pennines? It could be a moral personal dilemma. The positive for Manchester United is they have the resources, pulling power and funds to bring in someone of Håland’s talent. Because make no mistake about it, his next move is going to be big money – £50 million at the very least and probably more if several clubs are competing for his signature. It might be he’s sold as early as this January, although Salzburg is reportedly keen for a loan back until the end of the season. Whatever happens, we know that amazing Norwegian talent is making huge strides in the game right now and he will go right to the very very top.

Toggle menu Toggle menu 50 Talents to Follow in 2021 by L'Ultimo Uomo 5 February 2021 Scouting Time New year, new list of exciting talents to follow. Don’t miss our annual list of young prospects from the beautiful game. Brought to you by L’Ultimo Uomo. Never have we had a start like this, the beginning of 2021, where we’ve wanted to throw away the past and look to the future. And few things tell us more about the future than young sporting talents. As per tradition, in the very first days of the year, L’Ultimo Uomo draws up a list of the most interesting young players to follow this season. Human beings and stories to be passionate about straight away so you can enjoy them better throughout the season. The nerdiest of you will know most of them, others just a few. The age limit this year is set at those born in 2001, so very strong young 20-year-olds like Erling Haaland, Jadon Sancho, Alphonso Davies and Phil Foden have been left out. You can however look at previous editions of this article here: 2020 and 2019. Youssoufa Moukoko, 2004, Borussia Dortmund (Germany/Cameroon) First of all, credit must be given to Youssoufa Moukoko for bringing back a bit of mystery to contemporary football. We have been talking about him since he was twelve years old in Borussia Dortmund’s Under-17 team, with the usual suspicions about the age of a player born in Africa, in Cameroon, and the mystery of statistics that seem to be made up. Even if in reality the goals he’s scored are indisputable; these are numbers from other eras, which evoke the legends of the strikers with a thousand and more career goals, even if they haven’t all been recorded on video. Moukoko scored 90 goals in 50 games when he was 13, playing against 17-year-olds, and scored 47 in 25 at the age of 15, against opponents who were 19. He had scored 10 in the first 3 games of last season before it was interrupted by the Covid-19 pandemic. The mystery about numbers or age shouldn’t exist (the latter denied by his father, who said he registered his birth at the German Embassy the day after he was born), but doubting such a precocious and devastating talent serves to prolong the amazement: did this Moukoko really come to Europe to rewrite all the records in football history? In September he was called up by the German youth team and even Joachim Löw is reportedly keeping an eye on him for the future. The Bundesliga lowered the age he could be contracted, from 16 and a half to 16, and last December he started against Werder Bremen, becoming the youngest player to make his debut in the German league. Three days later, he became the youngest scorer ever, scoring with a left-footed missile against Union Berlin, in a similar fashion to Haaland’s violent shots. Arriving in Germany at the age of 10, Moukoku was obviously very ambitious: he talked about winning the Champions League with Dortmund. With similar numbers and crazy hype around him (he already has a multi-million contract with Nike), it’s hard to take into account the fact that we’re talking about a 16-year-old boy. When Moukoko plays, age is both seen and not seen at the same time. We are talking about a striker with a low center of gravity – he’s about 179 cm – who can protect the ball well, run very fast with the ball, and has phenomenal control with his left foot (and he also uses his right one, both for dribbling and to shoot). He doesn’t have the awareness like Messi, Neymar or Ousmane Dembélé, but it’s how his technique combines with speed that makes him devastating when he starts with the ball. He also has an excellent vision of the game, moves well without the ball like a true center-forward (his Union goal came from cutting in behind the defender while being on the verge of offside), and a level of creativity that makes him useful as a finisher. In the box, however, he is above all a goal machine; his shots are always dangerous, angled and strong, even when they do not come out as strong as hand grenades. Of course, he has to take measures if he wants to play at an even higher level of football, against tougher opponents, and needs to build himself up physically – it would be strange if he didn’t do so. If in the youth academies he could almost do everything he wanted – stretch out in the large spaces, dribble past opponents who are still not very explosive, shoot from every position. In the game and a half he has played so far, it was understood that he’ll need time as an apprentice, even if he is a phenomenon. However, we have seen little to help understand what kind of impact talents like his can have in the Bundesliga (he scored one goal in nine games and created other chances, which is already no small thing) and next year he could surprise us again. Youssoufa Moukoko is the young man with the eyes of world football on him and even if he doesn’t become a revelation in 2021, well, in 12 months time he will still only be 17 (he turns 17 in November). Rayan Ait Nouri, 2001, Wolverhampton (France/Algeria) Nouri was one of the wonders in last season’s revelations in Ligue 1, Angers. He plays left-back but only thinks about bombing forwards; he’s technical, left-footed and lightweight – he’s so slender that he doesn’t seem nearly six feet tall. Wolves took him on loan with the option to make the move permanent, and on his second appearance, he scored a beautiful goal with a clever run into the box and a shot at the far post that looked like a volley. Wolves’ three-man defense should help him integrate into the team as it enhances his offensive instincts while providing him with some defensive protection. Today Nouri is a ‘two-faced’ left-back: offensively very strong, especially with the speed he attacks the wing with and without the ball, plus his great crossing ability. But he still has to work on his defensive game – plus he absolutely needs to work on his physical shape. Rodrygo, 2001, Real Madrid (Brazil) We invited you to follow him in 2020, the year he became the second-youngest player to score a hat-trick in the Champions League (behind Raúl), the third youngest overall scorer in Real Madrid history. Rodrygo seems to have concentrated his energy into his entry onto the football scene. Apart from that, he didn’t do much, but he did reshape a bit of the perception we had of him last year. He looked like a twig, a wren unprepared for European football, with his game all about technique and agility. Instead, he turned out to be more ready and practical than we could have imagined. Not as in love as Vinicius Jr. is with the ball, perhaps even less talented, but he does move better without the ball. Because of this, he mainly played on Real Madrid’s weaker side. He seemed comfortable in the penalty area, despite having scored his 7 goals in just a few games. Of course, electricity in tight spaces, ball control and creativity while dribbling remain his best qualities. But in a team that can boast elite dribblers like Hazard and Vinicius Jr., or players who love to touch the ball a lot like Benzema and Modric, Rodrygo will have to continue to demonstrate his ability to move on the periphery of the game. Bukayo Saka, 2001, Arsenal (England) Born in London and raised at Arsenal, Saka has always been recognized as one of the spearheads of the new generation in English football. After impressing at youth level, he was promoted to the first team by Unai Emery while still a youngster. He made his debut in the 2018/19 season and since then, he has already become a regular, despite his young age. The confidence that he already has from an athletic point of view, plus his mental attributes in terms of tactics and determination, then led Arteta to make him the joker of the team. He started left-back in the absence of Tierney, then was used as a left-winger in a 3-4-3, and before returning to his role on the left-wing, he was sometimes used as a left midfielder or attacking midfielder. In his last games of 2020, he finished as right-winger. What reassures Arteta is that at the base of Saka’s versatility are technical but also mental skills – a player who seems immune to external pressure. At the age of 19, he signed a bumper contract and took the number 7 shirt, exceeded 60 appearances with Arsenal, scored a beautiful goal in the derby with Chelsea, and has already made his debut and played as a starter in the national team. He is a very fast player, good at always maintaining balance even after physical contact and has very quick movement. The talent is evident, a winger with great direction with pure dribbling skills, where he can exploit play with his two-footedness. His technical execution is where he can improve: he is a creative player but still not flawless with his first touch or with his passing. But neither is Sancho nor Foden. In the game, however, he reaches great levels, especially thanks to his talent and his unpredictability. His explosiveness represents one of the joys a supporter of Arsenal has, a team that lives in the terror of mediocrity. If 2021 is going to the beginning of a rebirth for the North London team then the rebirth will surely pass through Saka’s feet. Takefusa Kubo, 2001, Getafe/Real Madrid (Japan) Once a Barcelona youth player but now on the books of Real Madrid, with a loan spell last season at Mallorca and Villareal and, since January, at Getafe, Takefusa Kubo is one of those prodigies we write about every year where we hope the difficult adaptation into professional football is just a step before great things. Will next year be a good year for Kubo? The one in which without any doubt we will be able to say that he is a player at the highest level and maybe Real Madrid will decide to give him a chance? Impossible to know. Kubo’s talent remains exceptional, his basic technique is on par with the best and everything he does with his left foot is done well: control, direction, through balls and crosses. He looks mature but remains difficult to understand. Emery, at Villareal, made him play almost every game, but none in full, and after more than one season he didn’t even seem to have decided definitively whether he preferred to have him play on the right (where, running back inside, he can play through balls to the top or change the play) or left (where instead he can drive for many meters). Even in the Japanese national team, where he’s in and out of the side, it is not clear where he expresses himself best. He seems to be missing something, and it could be his age or the teams he plays for. Kubo could also be this player right here, considering the fact that physically there is not much room for improvement (we are talking about a player who is about 173 cm), or it could be just a matter of time and, perhaps, the right coach. Pedri, 2002, Barcelona (Spain) Comparisons are always misleading (no player is equal to another), even more so if comparisons are being made to legends like Andrés Iniesta. But it is difficult not to compare him to Pedri – the Canarian bought in September 2019 by Barcelona immediately following his debut in the first team with Las Palmas – who has some traits similar to those of “Don Andrés”. Like Iniesta, Pedri is small and technical, prefers to move to the left-hand side between the attacking midfielders and the midfield, has exceptional control, and already has a very high level of timing and ability to make space. Taking the ball off him is really difficult, especially when he gets wide and when he moves more in the middle between the lines. Not only is he already involved in the close and quick exchanges that characterize Barcelona’s style at the edge of the box (his first assist in La Liga was a short pass to Messi, just outside the box), but he’s also compared to Iniesta for his ability further down the pitch, for his ability to control the ball and not lose it even when surrounded by opponents, as well as being able to give continuity to the play. Obviously, his influence on the Barcelona game is not comparable to that of Iniesta, and Pedri still has to grow a lot to get closer to those levels, but the signs are encouraging. Not even 18 years old, he dominated proceedings in an important match in Turin in the Champions League against Juventus. He gave Cuadrado a bad night and masterfully managed possession on the left side of the pitch, doing almost nothing wrong – 40 successful passes out of 42 and 8 completed dribbles out of 10. For now, it has remained an extraordinary performance within a non-phenomenal start to the season, although it has still been positive (between November and December he frequently started). Pedri, however, seems to have the skills that will help transform his game, and as he accumulates minutes and experience, his gameplay will become normal. Eduardo Camavinga, 2002, Rennes (France) A little over a year ago we wrote: “If you watched a Rennes game without knowing anything about the number 18 in midfield, you would never guess that he is a teenager.” He had recently become the first player born in 2002 to make his debut in what we typically define as one of the top five European leagues. He is only 18 years old, a fact his coach Julien Stéphan (also very young, just turned 40) has probably forgotten, who in the meantime has put the number 10 shirt on his back and, above all, has given him more and more responsibility. Camavinga has gone from organizing the play with surprising maturity (as one of two defensive midfielders or as the central midfielder in a trio) to having to drive his team’s offensive play by acting as a creative midfielder, sometimes dropping deep himself to take the ball from the defense or the playmaker, even in his team’s own half, with a man pressing him or a low line of defenders waiting for his attacking ball or waiting to close the spaces in case of a through ball. And so Camavinga is facing his first difficulties since turning pro. Nothing to worry about, considering the fact that he recently turned 18 and his “season of confirmation” (as they call it in France) in 2020/21 is an exaggeration. In any case, even recently he has shown exceptional things. In September, in the second round of the league against Montpellier, he scored a fantastic goal, running through midfield with a triangle on the left side of the pitch and then ran directly towards the defense, ran into the area, began to fake, and then made space for himself for a strong and accurate left diagonal shot, aiming at the far post from a tight angle. A month later, just eight minutes into his second match for the national team, against Ukraine, he scored his first goal with an absurd overhead kick in the penalty area. After a header from Giroud was saved by the goalkeeper, he found the bouncing ball a few steps from the near post, and in a fraction of a second, he turned his back, kicked it over his head over two defenders and under the crossbar. That goal made him go down in history as the second-youngest player ever to score for France, the youngest ever since World War I (more than a century ago). A few days later, however, against Croatia, Deschamps reprimanded him harshly for having slightly delayed his run on Vlasic, who collected a low cross from the right and scored the equalizer to make it 1-1 (France then won 2-1). It must be said that Camavinga, moments before in that same play, had gone to close an opponent on the opposite side (and Nzonzi was just as close to Vlasic), but the fact is that after that game he wasn’t called up again to the national team. A few weeks ago Deschamps recalled that “a first call-up is nothing definitive, it is only the first step”, and that Camavinga now has to respond to the expectations that are on him, now his level is rising. There is talk of interest from Real Madrid and PSG, but the situation Camavinga is currently experiencing shows us how even a player who seems destined for great things can face difficulties. Step by step and day by day, the sooner you get to a high level, the sooner those difficulties begin. Gabriel Veron, 2002, Palmeiras (Brazil) Gabriel Veron is said to be able to run at 38 km/h. We can’t measure him with the naked eye, but we can see that when he gets going, the defenders just seem to be left standing. They don’t go slower, they just stop. He has short and stocky legs that seem to give him different gravity with his passing but also with his small movements in confined spaces. He plays for Palmeiras and is considered by some to be the world’s best player born in 2002, mainly because he definitely ticks the box for offensive talent. He makes things happen, he’s a constant danger to teams and he makes them wonder every time he has the ball at his feet. For the simple fact that he travels at a completely different speed, Veron is definitely special. He can play either wing, left or right. In the historical pantheon of Brazilian talents, he does not belong to the Robinho and Neymar family: lightweight and extremely skillful, but rather he resembles Lucas Moura: a crazy metal ball thrown against the opponent’s defense. In the last few meters, he still has to refine his precision, both in reading the game and on a technical level. His passes often arrive too early or they’re over hit by a few centimeters. We will need to see how much his extraordinary speed and meticulous control in tight spaces continues to make a difference, even at the highest levels. His YouTube compilations, meanwhile, are one of the most hallucinating experiences. It has a strange effect on our imagination that this Veron exists, so completely different to his illustrious predecessors: small, Brazilian, very fast, inelegant. A Football Manager game has gone on for too long. However, the hype around him is so intense that 2021 could already be the year he moves to Europe. Riccardo Calafiori, 2002, Rome (Italy) The first time that the name Riccardo Calafiori came to everyone was after a very bad injury suffered in October 2018 with the Roma youth team. Calafiori had broken all the ligaments in his knee, all the menisci, and the joint cartilage – one of those injuries that put an end to a career prematurely. In the days after, Dzeko held up one of his shirts after a goal and Daniele De Rossi visited him in the hospital (and after). Fortunately, Calafiori was back on the pitch after a long time out from the game and at the end of last season, he made his debut with the first team, scoring a beautiful goal against Juventus, which was then taken away through no fault of his own. From that point onwards he has not left Fonseca’s squad and, in a role in which the Giallorossi team is short, he seemed to be able to play regularly, but was stopped at the beginning of the season by the coronavirus, losing his place to others. Calafiori is not a typical full-back: tall and big, not fast with his short runs but very intense with long runs. At the moment he seems to offer more guarantees as a wide winger in Roma’s 3-4-2-1 than in a 4-man defense as a left-back. He is not particularly creative. Indeed, with the ball he takes as little risk as possible, but he moves well without it and has a really powerful left foot, as demonstrated by his goal against Young Boys, a shot from outside the area that the goalkeeper didn’t even see. After that goal, Fonseca brought him back down to earth: “For me, Calafiori has yet to grow, he is young and talented. For you he is the best in the world, that doesn’t help him”. In 2021 he will have to win the trust of his coach to put minutes in his legs, but at 18 already being part of a team at the top of Italian football is certainly a guarantee of talent. William Saliba, 2001, Nizza/Arsenal (France) William Saliba was signed by Arsenal on 25th July 2019 for 30 million euros, at the end of his first season as a professional with Saint Etienne. He stayed in France for another year, preparing to take leadership of a defense that needed to rebuild itself on new foundations. A year later, Saliba moved to Mikel Arteta’s Arsenal, and even in one of the most disastrous teams in European football, and in a defense that struggles to find performers up to par, he has not yet made his debut. He played in the reserve team on pitches where you can see the roads in the background. Arsenal had three places in defense this year, but instead, they preferred to play the precarious David Luiz, the adapted full-back Tierney, the adapted full-back Kolasinac, the very rigid Rob Holding, the adapted midfielder Elneny or the worn-out Shkodran Mustafi. It’s hard to tell if Arteta doesn’t trust Saliba, or if he just doesn’t think he is up to it. It’s ironic that Saliba at Saint Etienne played on the right of a three-man defense: precisely the role in which Arsenal seem to be exposed. It was said that he had great performances in training and that he could return to Saint Etienne. Certainly, in 2021 we will finally have to expect something from one of the most talented young defenders in the world. In the January transfer market, he ended up on loan to Nice, where he will perhaps be able to show his qualities again.

Toggle menu Toggle menu Dani Alves: technical overview of Coppa Italia decisive player by Mattia Fontana 19 May 2017 The Match Analyst Dani Alves, once again, proved to be decisive in the most important moment. After the double semi-final against Monaco where he stood out for his active contribution to all four Juventus goals, he also made the difference in Coppa Italia. It was a match in which he made his mark with the opening goal, but also with a performance bordering on perfection. It is not by chance that we are talking about a player capable of winning 32 titles in his career and no less than 25 finals out of the 30 in which he has participated. Created with Wyscout Report / Playlist & Draw Apps The position that is highlighting Dani Alves’ skills in this season finale is a mixture of the fullback position that he has played in the past and that of a wing. Barzagli covers his back in the defensive phase, often spreading out onto the right wing. Whereas Dybala becomes the perfect finisher for his short passes in the final 30 metres. Ball Possession Recovery (Left), Ball Possession Loss (Right) Created with Wyscout Report Crosses (Left), Through Passes (Right) Created with Wyscout Report Attacking Duels, Goal Created with Wyscout Report / Playlist & Draw Apps The Coppa Italia final was Dani Alves’ masterpiece. He was the third-ranked player in the match for ball recoveries (5), second for Juventus behind Barzagli and Alex Sandro (6). But at the same time, he was also the second-ranked player in losing the least number of balls (only 2) behind Lemina (who only played 12’ though). He was second for Juventus in crosses made (2, both in the final third of the pitch), but also second for killer passes (2). The place where all of his quality dominates is in duels, both offensive and defensive. In both the former and the latter, he was the best for Juventus. The confrontation with his direct rival, Lulic, was even mocking. Created with Wyscout Report / Playlist & Draw Apps Dani Alves’ quality becomes explosive when it is combined with Dybala’s, a player with whom he can connect as he did with Messi in his time with Barcelona. It is not by chance that this is the passing passing combination that Juventus exploits the most. The Brazilian has passed the ball to the Argentinian 13 times, whereas Dybala has served him 14 times. In total: 45 touches, 42 attempted passes and 93% completed. One successful long forward pass (and only one attempted), one successful killer pass, two correct passes in the penalty area out of two attempted, two crosses out of two successful, one goal resulting from the only shot on goal.

But Casemiro’s contribution to the cause of a Real Madrid that is astonishingly back in the race for the Liga and in the Champions League semi-finals can be anything but overlooked. On a team nurtured by offensive players, his presence is more essential than ever to provide balance to the defensive phase. And not only. Because the Brazilian knows how to use the ball. If there were any doubts, just consider that in the current Champions League he is ranked ninth midfielder in completed passes (87%) out of more than 500 balls played. This is a skill that goes with his main characteristic, being the midfielder with the highest number of duels won in matches (67, with no less than 22 tackles) and the fifth ranked for defensive plays (43). More statistical proof lies in Real Madrid’s overall “plus/minus”. With him on the pitch, the Merengues have a 75% victory rating and 69.5% without him. Casemiro’s presence implies a lower number of goals scored per match (from 2.91 with him to 2.75 without) but also a lower number of goals conceded: from 0.91 to 0.625. Here is Casemiro’s unique quality in the Casa Blanca balance. [/av_textblock] [av_hr class=’invisible’ height=’50’ shadow=’no-shadow’ position=’center’ custom_border=’av-border-thin’ custom_width=’100%’ custom_border_color=” custom_margin_top=’10px’ custom_margin_bottom=’20px’ icon_select=’no’ custom_icon_color=’#83a846′ icon=’ue87b’ font=’entypo-fontello’] [av_image src=’https://wyscout.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Copertura-difensiva-.jpg’ attachment=’23801′ attachment_size=’full’ align=’center’ styling=” hover=” link=” target=’_blank’ caption=” font_size=” appearance=” overlay_opacity=’0.4′ overlay_color=’#000000′ overlay_text_color=’#ffffff’ animation=’no-animation’][/av_image] [av_textblock size=” font_color=” color=”] Casemiro’s most obvious contribution is the defensive coverage he provides in addition to the coverage of the two centre backs. In this case, Pepe allows the opponent to overtake him in an offensive transition against Manchester City. Casemiro sees the danger and cuts off the adversary’s trajectory to obstruct the counter-attack. [/av_textblock] [av_hr class=’invisible’ height=’20’ shadow=’no-shadow’ position=’center’ custom_border=’av-border-thin’ custom_width=’100%’ custom_border_color=” custom_margin_top=’10px’ custom_margin_bottom=’20px’ icon_select=’no’ custom_icon_color=’#83a846′ icon=’ue87b’ font=’entypo-fontello’] [av_image src=’https://wyscout.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Pressione.jpg’ attachment=’23803′ attachment_size=’full’ align=’center’ styling=” hover=” link=” target=” caption=” font_size=” appearance=” overlay_opacity=’0.4′ overlay_color=’#000000′ overlay_text_color=’#ffffff’ animation=’no-animation’][/av_image] [av_textblock size=” font_color=” color=”] However, Casemiro’s contribution is not only coverage, but it is also active and connected to the pressure applied at midfield. When Kroos and Modric are unable to go after the ball carrier and Real is running the risk of a turnover, he skilfully closes the gaps in a position farther forward. Even at the cost of committing a tactical foul like on this occasion. [/av_textblock] [av_hr class=’invisible’ height=’20’ shadow=’no-shadow’ position=’center’ custom_border=’av-border-thin’ custom_width=’100%’ custom_border_color=” custom_margin_top=’10px’ custom_margin_bottom=’20px’ icon_select=’no’ custom_icon_color=’#83a846′ icon=’ue87b’ font=’entypo-fontello’] [av_image src=’https://wyscout.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Alleggerimento-.jpg’ attachment=’23799′ attachment_size=’full’ align=’center’ styling=” hover=” link=” target=” caption=” font_size=” appearance=” overlay_opacity=’0.4′ overlay_color=’#000000′ overlay_text_color=’#ffffff’ animation=’no-animation’][/av_image] [av_textblock size=” font_color=” color=”] In the build-up phase, Casemiro is useful for freeing up Modric and Kroos’ creativity, allowing them to move between the lines and alternate their line-up. But, thanks to his technical qualities, he can also be useful in taking off pressure. In this specific example, Modric risks losing the ball because the opponents have him double-teamed. Casemiro, on the other hand, is open and the Croatian is able to pass the ball back to him in order to start the play over. [/av_textblock] [av_hr class=’invisible’ height=’20’ shadow=’no-shadow’ position=’center’ custom_border=’av-border-thin’ custom_width=’100%’ custom_border_color=” custom_margin_top=’10px’ custom_margin_bottom=’20px’ icon_select=’no’ custom_icon_color=’#83a846′ icon=’ue87b’ font=’entypo-fontello’] [av_image src=’https://wyscout.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Copertura-4-1-4-1.jpg’ attachment=’23800′ attachment_size=’full’ align=’center’ styling=” hover=” link=” target=” caption=” font_size=” appearance=” overlay_opacity=’0.4′ overlay_color=’#000000′ overlay_text_color=’#ffffff’ animation=’no-animation’][/av_image] [av_textblock size=” font_color=” color=”] This is the difference between Zidane‘s Real and the one managed by his two predecessors, Benitez and Ancelotti. If the overall attitude of the current team reminds you of the one during the time when the Italian was on the bench (it’s no coincidence that Zidane was his assistant in the 2013-14 season), the changes in the defensive phase are easy to see. From the Spaniard’s 4-2-3-1 formation to Ancelotti’s 4-4-2, Real lines up 4-1-4-1. Credit for this goes to a hardcore midfielder like Casemiro.

Toggle menu Toggle menu The four best dribblers in the Premier League by L'Ultimo Uomo 5 December 2019 Scouting Time Dribbling is a very important component of football. Truth to be told, apart from scoring goals – which clearly is the most entertaining aspect of all – dribbling is the action that most makes supporter jump on their feet, leaving defenders in the dust and becoming viral on the internet. And since the Premier League is known as the most entertaining league of all, we asked our very talented friends at L’Ultimo Uomo to find the four most-addictive dribblers in the English championship. Don’t miss them! Saint-Maximin must do more than dribble by Daniele Manusia Allan Saint-Maximin joined Newcastle last summer after three seasons of first-team football in Ligue 1. He is only 22 years old but has been playing as a pro since he turned 16. In 2013, he became the youngest player ever to play for Saint-Etienne, where he learned his trade. Then he went to Monaco, which farmed him out on loan for two years to Hannover and Bastia, before his transfer to OGC Nice for €10M (the most expensive signing in the club’s history, before the arrival of Dolberg for 20 million). His father, a driver at Diderot University in Paris, remembers that he began walking and talking early. Saint-Maximin is super-gifted physically. As a child, he excelled in gymnastics and won cross-country and decathlon competitions, but he was also a perfectionist who wanted to do well in all subjects, perhaps thanks to his mother, a teacher. By the time he was 12 he was already known nationally within youth football, always playing with boys older than him by two or three years and he was two or three years underage at Saint-Etienne. All the scouts and coaches who saw him as a child agree that he was exceptional. Saint-Etienne’s scout Dominique Fernandez, said: “I’ve never seen anything like it in my 20-year career.” Yet, Allan Saint-Maximin couldn’t establish himself at Monaco (where it must be said, he had competition from people like Bernardo Silva, Martial, Lemar, Mbappé). Even today people feel that he lacks that extra ingredient to make him a top-class player. Saint-Maximin attempted 15 dribbles vs Villa, just under half were successful, which is pretty impressive. However… xG – 0.08 xA – 0.00Crosses completed – 4/1 Team-mates don’t help but if he can improve decision making/final ball… https://t.co/MSJt19mYJf — David Alexander Hughes (@DAHughes_) November 26, 2019 Dribbling has always been his speciality. Perhaps to emphasise this, in an interview with the Telegraph Saint-Maximin said he had “not been trained” in it, because in the youth teams you are taught to play one or two touches. Instead, he dribbles a lot. We could even say that dribbling is almost all he does. In fact, at the moment, rather than a rough diamond his path seems to be that of someone fated to struggle to meet expectations, of a potential phenomenon that for now is just entertaining to watch. “I know that fans like dribbling, but I also want to finish with goals and assists”, he said in another interview, on Newcastle’s TV channel. “Because you don’t win games by dribbling.” Since the start of the season he has attempted a total of 61 dribbles (Zaha weighs in at 84 but with twice as many minutes on the pitch), 9.6 every 90 minutes, of which the majority were successful (5.7, against 3.9 unsuccessful). These are impressive figures, especially for a rookie in the most frenetic and toughest championship in Europe, but Saint-Maximin has yet to produce his first assist or score his first goal. He came close against Aston Villa with a nice angled shot, in a game where he attempted even 15 dribbles. However, since most of his shots start from outside the area (1.4 out of 2.4 on average every 90 minutes), the coefficient of difficulty is always very high. It goes without saying that Saint-Maximin needs to improve his decision-making and that perhaps a defensive team like Newcastle, which has only scored 11 goals so far this season (the second-worst attack in the league), in which he is practically the only player who dribbles (on average Newcastle attempt 10.2 dribbles per game), is probably not helping him. However, it is also perhaps his dribbling style that is making his life difficult. As mentioned above, he played one of his best games against Aston Villa, but he also missed a one-on-one chance against the goalkeeper and wasted at least one counterattack, when after covering about 50 metres he laid on a poor pass that Almiron found too difficult to control. Villa’s defenders (like all those in the Premier League) struggled to catch him, but on more than one occasion Saint-Maximin came up against his limitations. Starting from the left, he can take the ball with his right, continuously threatening to turn infield, moving fluidly with frequent touches. If his opponents let him run down the line, he stretches the ball, and then finally stops and crosses with his right. His close control, the powerful legs with which he protects the ball well and quick turns in tight spaces, rotating left to keep his opponent behind him, means he can release the ball in almost any situation. His trickiest opponent is the throw-in line. Starting a move on the left, he veers right and takes the ball maybe for a few dozen yards, before pulling up in front of an opponent and moving out left again using the inside of his foot. Then he stops once more, pirouettes and darts diagonally to the right. And yet, this continuous improvisation is a double-edged sword. This is because while he finds the space to close, other spaces also close, maybe including those for an assist. His teammates also struggle to anticipate where he will go, and when they do, it is hard to keep up with him. So, when it is time to raise his head and knock the ball into the area, Saint-Maximin still tries to be creative. He can slip from omnipotence to impotence within a fraction of a second. The action that perhaps best exemplifies this side to his game is the one illustrated above. With an opponent on him, on the right side of the pitch, Saint-Maximin appears only able to use his left foot to cross. Otherwise, he has to drop back. Instead, he takes a very skilled and explosive touch using the outside of his right foot to burn off his opponent on the place. In the time it takes for his marker to turn Saint-Maximin is already in the penalty area, almost on the far touchline. From there, in theory, he could play one of the most dangerous balls there is, a pass back to an attacker, but his touch is heavy and inaccurate, so the ball just slams into one of his teammates before bouncing off out of the area. At the start of the move, Saint-Maximin did superbly to open a seemingly almost inexistent space, which probably only he could find, but a moment later he failed to make the pass that many players less technical than he would have managed. A total of 1.7 key passes (always on average over 90 minutes) would also be a good figure if Saint-Maximin did not appear to be mentally drained by the time it comes to the final pass. At that point, improvising and deciding what to do at the last moment the ball is inaccurate or too strong. Matches are not won by dribbling and football is not a sprint race. Saint-Maximin knows this well, and he knows what he lacks. Can one of the most entertaining players in the Premier League also become one of the most effective? It won’t be easy, but if he succeeds, he will be really unstoppable. Pépé has yet to fit in at Arsenal by Dario Saltari Nicolas Pépé is certainly not enjoying the triumphant entry to the Premier League that he perhaps expected when Arsenal signed him last summer for almost €80M. The Ivorian winger has only scored one league goal so far. After a difficult start to the season, Emery dropped him from the starting line-up in the last three Premier League games. The whole Arsenal club is going through a crisis, of course, but so is he in his own game, which is so obsessively based on one-against-one, in a championship where defenders are faster, more athletic, and more technical than in Ligue 1. Nevertheless, if we want to see the glass as half full we can look at his dribble success rate. Despite all these difficulties, Pépé is still a top dribbler. He succeeds in 4.3 dribbles every 90 minutes out of a total of 6.5 attempts, fewer (among players with at least 250 minutes on the pitch) only than Boufal, Saint-Maximin and Zaha. Pépé successfully executes almost exactly two out of three dribbles, so perhaps we can hope that his situation will improve when Arsenal start to play better. Nicolas Pépé is 24 years old and has been plying his trade at the top-level for three years, yet he still looks like a street footballer. This is not necessarily a bad thing. With the ball between his feet, Pépé has some original ideas. His version of dribbling is extravagant and ornate, which at its best is wonderful to watch, especially in the Premier League where extreme athleticism and ever greater tactical organisation seem to level out players too much of a muchness. Pépé’s dribbling is mainly about waiting for the defender to commit, on giving the impression that he has effortless mastery of the ball, and on trusting his ability to whip it away at the last moment. In this sense, his game is first and foremost based on trickery. He beats his man in the same way that carnivorous plants attract insects into their jaws, by making them think they can go there safely. For example, he can shift the ball at the last second with the outside of his foot or quickly pass it with two touches from one foot to another, or also draw it towards himself with his studs to evade his opponent’s attempted tackle. The distribution of Pépé’s attempted dribbling this season. However, unlike a carnivorous plant, the defender can end up devouring Pépé, which often happens, for example, when he cannot control the ball when running or when his close technique is not up to the lofty ambition of his dribbling. And this is why when watching him the dividing line between excitement and frustration is much subtler than for other footballers. In his best moments, however, Pépé is one of those players whose moves from a single game can fill an entire YouTube skills video. His technique in tight spaces allows him to use every part of the foot in a single move. And this can only be good news for Arsenal fans, waiting for him to mature all the other aspects of his game, starting with the end product. He needs these aspects if his technique and dribbling are going to serve the team in a way that makes the most of his qualities. Wilfried Zaha and the price of creativity by Emanuele Atturo In June, like every summer, Wilfried Zaha’s name was bandied around the transfer market websites. Manchester United, Inter, Napoli, and Arsenal approached him. However, in the end, as usual, he stayed at Crystal Palace, which fended off any offers by valuing him at close to 80 million pounds. The reason for the interest in Zaha is easy to see: for years he has been one of the best specialist dribblers. In an era when the search for space on the pitch is more and more pressing, dribbling has become fundamental. It is both increasingly sought after and at the same time rare. Dribbling is one of football’s more instinctive aspects, not a skill that can be learned and trained. It is all about your relationship with the ball, and with that highly mysterious football gift, a sense of trickery. To summarise, the two main ways to dribble are either using technique or athletic skills. The first is indispensable in tight spaces and the second in wide areas. Zaha excels in both. He can dribble past his opponent at will: accelerating by stretching the ball or with tricks in tighter spaces. Sure, he is not an elite technician, but Zaha compensates with extraordinary creativity, which his team demands in a rather extreme way. Zaha’s many (successful) dribbles. Indeed, Zaha’s style of play is strongly conditioned by Roy Hodgson’s Crystal Palace system. They are a reactive team who love to attack with long transitions where the Ivorian winger is always the first outlet. Hence his consistently impressive statistics. This year he has attempted 6.8 dribbles every 90 minutes, with a very high completion rate of 4.7. Zaha starts from the left and guides the ball with the outside of his foot. Then he usually performs a feint – a stepover, a touch of his studs – before heading off elsewhere. In typical Zaha fashion, even when he has a man on, he is still dangerous, with his rather refined use of his studs. Zaha’s flair and creativity plus an ability to continuously create numerical superiority, mean that he is an indispensable resource for a team like Crystal Palace, not hugely talented going forward and that must rely on his individual qualities Zaha, therefore, has a lot of responsibility within his team’s system, but at the same time, he is very productive in terms of assists. Last season was his best in terms of the end product, with 10 goals and 5 assists. This was a lot but perhaps not enough to justify Crystal Palace’s valuation. This season some of his early performances have been a bit laboured and so far he has recorded just one goal and one assist. Nevertheless, in recent days he seems to be finding his feet, playing superbly against Liverpool. Zaha is not yet very productive playing in a system where wingers are asked to make a very specific contribution. However, it is not clear whether this is down to his qualities or to a system that requires him mainly to receive the ball on the touchline. In January, Zaha may not stay at Crystal Palace, and at 27, it is probably time to see him in a system that forces him out of his comfort zone. Sofiane Boufal – dribbling with no great turn of pace by Emanuele Mongiardo In the summer of 2017, Sofiane Boufal was the most expensive signing in the history of Southampton. After some excellent seasons at Lille, expectations were high, but the Moroccan failed to establish himself. The Saints were caught up in a relegation battle, and Boufal even ended up out of the squad at the end of the season. He refused to warm up against Chelsea and, as a punishment, Hughes sent him to train with the U23s. In the summer, he went out on loan to Celta Vigo, another dysfunctional team involved in a relegation fight. Despite a gritty season, in over 2000 minutes, Boufal completed 6.2 dribbles every 90 minutes. These are remarkable figures that say a lot about his most brilliant feature, namely his dribbling. Returned in England during summer, Boufal seems now intent on making a name for himself at Southampton. Hasenhuttl is a different type of coach to Hughes. He aims for a more structured style of football both in terms of pressing and offensive build up. Boufal started for the first time in the line-up on matchday 4 against United, partly because of injuries to Djenepo and Redmond. In the 3-4-3 employed by the Saints, attacking midfielders need to alternate movements towards the wings to help the lateral chains and reception in the half-spaces. Boufal can be used for both types of play and can adapt his instinct for dribbling to different areas of the pitch. Everything comes down to his extraordinarily skilled feet, which can dominate possession even in the tightest spaces. His technique is clearly above average. We can see it in how, with each touch, he adjusts his distance from the ball, both when running and stopping. Between the lines, he tries to beat a man with his first touch. If he has turned his back, he anticipates the pressure of his opponent to direct the ball into the space freed by his exit and gain a view of the goal. When he receives face-on, he can beat a man in so many ways. Boufal is not particularly fast, but his light physique makes him agile when shifting sideways. He deftly changes direction. He doesn’t need to hare off suddenly. His control of ball and body when turning allows him to steal time from the defender even when he is well-positioned and able to follow him. Boufal is always in control when one-on-one. If there is not much space to change direction, then he uses all his evasive skills to make his opponent lose balance or to drag him out of position. He shimmies with his pelvis and legs to fake a dribble or a turn in an attempt to make the defender commit to one side and invite him to tackle. If the player takes the bait, then there is room for a change in lateral direction. At that point, he easily shifts the ball and beats the man. Besides the ball, then, Boufal can manipulate his opponents’ decisions. This is not just handy when directly facing someone one-on-one, but also when attacked from the side or behind. Both on the wing and in the middle, the Moroccan easily turns towards goal. If his opponents are short, however, they need to cover less space to come back on him. Boufal could drive on but has neither the pure speed to leave his opponents behind immediately nor the strength to win a shoulder to shoulder duel. Aware of his limits, he slows down, invites the marker to block him from behind or from the side and then suddenly sets off again. He makes a turn and takes advantage of his lateral agility to cut up his opponent, slip in front of him and between him and the ball. Then once he is past him, he can run again. Boufal can run on goal, but he sees that Winks is recovering and may force him to stop. Then he stops for a second to catch his breath. Before Winks makes contact, Boufal arches over the ball and cuts through infield: so he puts himself in front of the Englishman who cannot get to the ball. Boufal finally leaves Winks in his wake. Boufal’s dribbles are an excellent lubricant for the Saints’ move. He beats his man 5.7 times every 90 minutes and is number one in the Premier League among players who have made at least five appearances. This is especially useful for Hasenhuttl. For us spectators, on the other hand, it is a pleasure to see his dribbling technique and talent, and the creativity typical of North African attacking midfielders. The former Lille man can control the ball on the inside, on the outside or with the sole of his boot and also has no problem using his weaker foot (the left). His awareness shines out especially in close spaces, where without technique there are no escape routes: Boufal wedges himself into tiny spaces and accompanies the ball into the free corridors, moving it faster than the defenders’ legs can react. His quick control is why he so often searches for the tunnel, an unexpected solution that with him becomes the rule. In Boufal’s dribbling, in the attempts to pass the ball between the defenders’ legs, he enjoys the primordial pleasure of feeling better than others, as if he were still in the playground.

Toggle menu Toggle menu How Djené Dakonam has become vital for Getafe UCL qualification race by Edward Stratmann 19 April 2019 The Match Analyst One of the big talking points from this season’s LaLiga crusade has been the magnificence of Getafe. Currently sitting in fifth place and running for a coveted Champions League qualification spot, Jose Bordalas’ supremely organised and dogged side’s defensive solidity has unquestionably been the cornerstone of their exceptional campaign. Having only conceded 29 goals in 32 matches, Getafe has the third-best defence in the league, behind only Atlético Madrid and Valencia, but strikingly above both Real Madrid and Barcelona. There’s been one man that’s really caught the eye, however, and that’s been the consistently excellent Djené Dakonam, who’s been an absolutely indispensable member of Los Azulones‘ squad. Djene’s tremendous output has unquestionably been key to their memorable rise, as his work both individually and collectively has been of the highest order and seen him acquit himself with aplomb throughout. Possessing wonderful relationships with his fellow centre-back in Leandro Cabrera, plus with his fullbacks Vitorino Antunes and Damian Suarez, they’ve formed a formidable backline. Concentrating intently, Djene moves cohesively in unison with his defensive comrades, as on top of keeping his spacing nicely between his colleagues to either side, he’s smoothly identified when to hold his post, shift laterally, push up and drop back. Getting these fundamental details spot on has subsequently ensured Getafe have been super compact and undertaken their manager’s meticulous demands beautifully. His excellent decision making also extends to when he’s fulfilling his marking duties or when providing support to a colleague. Responding brilliantly to pressing triggers like when his man drops deep to link play, is about to receive back to goal or in open body postures and when his adversary is about to latch onto an underhit or sloppy pass, he pounces sharply. Aggressive and forceful when applying pressure, he gets touch-tight, making it extremely difficult for his man to control cleanly, turn him or execute their passes easily, which regularly forces opponents into mistakes and turnovers. Djene touch-tight marking Reading the play shrewdly, the Togolese international’s smarts have been on show in many other ways, for he picks up the ball’s trajectory quickly to give himself every chance of cutting out crosses and cutbacks, plus when he swiftly covers behind his partner when he steps up to challenge his marker and by picking up any blown marking assignments from midfield. Djene smart coverage Djene covering support Despite standing only 182 cm, not huge by any means for a central defender, Djené‘s impressive physicality and athleticism, in combination with the aforementioned, ensures this isn’t a real problem. Whether using his explosive leap to compete manfully in headed duels, his searing pace to track runners in behind, his agility to manage tricky, pacy attackers or his hulking strength to outmuscle his foes, he’s an extremely tough customer to get the better of. Djene’s superb covering speed and expertly timed tackle Djene head scan and tracking runner A master at using his arms to fend off opponents or unbalance them, and at altering his body position to keep his opponent from reaching the ball, his strength serves him notably in many situations. Timing his interventions cleanly and so good at recovering possession to boot, there’s a lot to like about the determined stopper’s work. When his team’s in possession, Djené‘s contributions have been important in terms of building out from the back and carrying the ball forward. Making coherent decisions with his passing, he typically circulates possession calmly while waiting for a weakness in the opposition defensive shape. Moving the ball with speed and intent, he likes to add tempo to moves to increase his team’s chances of spotting an opening. While capable of hitting vertical line breaking passes, which he does so when the opportunity arises, he’s usually more of a connector who progresses the ball into Getafe’s more offensively gifted players. Djene’s excellent pass to switch play If he recognises a chance to dribble upfield, he’ll quickly do so, for he knows how vital this can be, as it can draw out a midfielder to press him, thus creating a free man upfield or open passing lanes. Djene provoking press before passing neatly Assured, measured and intelligent, the assertive Djené‘s numbers illustrate what a valuable component of Bordalas’ team he’s been. The completion of 5.42 interceptions per 90, 0.14 blocked shots p90, 2.85 clearances p90, 3.02 won aerial duels p90, one dribble p90 and 0.45 progressive runs p90, his all-around output is aptly illustrated by his numbers. A real leader within Bordalas’ squad, his superb relationship with his manager, who he previously worked with back in 2014 during a stint at Alcorcon, is clearly another factor towards his success. Knowing precisely what his manager expects of him and his teammates, Djené’s executed his instructions with assuredness and quality. Last year when quizzed on who was the best player he’s had under his command, Bordalas responded glowingly in favour of his charge, saying: “I have had very good players and I have very good players, if I had to choose one at the moment it’s Djené. He is a magnificent player.” Courtesy of his impeccable performances, the man who’s been one of the premier defenders in LaLiga this term has also attracted the interest of Barcelona and Arsenal, with many others reportedly set to join the competition for his signature in the summer. But all that talk will have to wait, for the 27-year-old’s focus remains solely on the last seven matches of the season, where Getafe will have to hold firm if they’re to achieve Champions League qualification, for they still have to face the likes of Barcelona, Real Madrid and Sevilla. Djené will unquestionably relish the challenge ahead of fighting it out with some of Spain’s finest outfits, though, for he attacks every challenge with enormous determination, grit and gusto. Expect the last seven matches to be no different. Images made with Wyscout “Playlist & Draw” tool. Start your free trial here!
